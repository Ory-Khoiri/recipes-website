        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground paprika</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>10 chicken wings</li>
            <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
            <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup hot sauce</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 pinch garlic powder</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Direction:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together flour, paprika, cayenne pepper, and salt in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Place chicken wings in a single layer in a 9x13-inch glass baking dish. Sprinkle flour mixture over top and toss until wings are evenly coated. Cover and refrigerate for 1 to 1 1/2 hours.</li>
            <li>Add about 1 inch oil to a deep, heavy skillet; heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). (The oil should be just enough to cover wings entirely.)</li>
            <li>While the oil is coming to temperature, combine butter, hot sauce, pepper, and garlic powder in a small saucepan over low heat. Cook and stir until butter is melted and mixture is thoroughly blended. Remove from the heat and reserve for serving.</li>
            <li>Fry coated wings in the hot oil for 10 to 15 minutes, or until they begin to crisp and turn brown. Maintain the oil temperature while cooking.</li>
            <li>Remove wings from the oil and place on a paper towel-lined plate</li>
            <li>Transfer wings to a platter and drizzle hot sauce over top; or mix wings and hot sauce in a bowl until coated. Serve.</li>
        </ol>
